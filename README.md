#OPinion-leaders-mining
Opinion leader is an important node in social networks and social media, and it also is the key factor of information transmission. It is difficult to identify the opinion leaders from a large number of members who participate in different topics in QQ group. This paper proposes a new way which based on the response relationship in the QQ group, to min the opinion leaders. Firstly, we build a response Word library, then build the user-response relationship network using Aho-Corasick algorithm. Lastly, we get the opinion leaders by analyzing the userâ€™s node statistic information of social network. The experimental results show that there is a high accuracy by using the method to min the opinion leaders of the QQ group data, when merging the importance of the user-interaction network nodes feature with QQ group, it is possible to achieve a better effect with mining opinion leaders.
